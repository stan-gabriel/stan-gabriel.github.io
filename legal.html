        </header>

        <p>Gabriel Stan ("us", "we", or "our") operates the https://stan-gabriel.github.io/ website (the "Service").</p>

        <p>We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection
            and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy,
            terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible from
            https://stan-gabriel.github.io/</p>

        <p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when
            you accessing Gabriel Stan`s website ("Site"), you agree to Gabriel Stan’s use of Cookies as outlined below.</p>


        <h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
        <p>Last Updated: May 28, 2019</p>

        <h3>1. Introduction: What is a cookie?</h3>

        <p>This Cookie policy helps to explain the occasions when and why cookies may be sent to visitors to the
            Site (referred to in this policy as “we”, “us” or “our”). “Cookies” are text-only pieces of information
            that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive or other website-browsing equipment for
            record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow the Site to remember important information that will make your
            use of the site more convenient. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the
            cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value.
            Certain cookies will be used on the Site regardless of whether you are logged in to your account or not.
            Session Cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the
            Site.</p>

        <p>Persistent Cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend
            on the lifetime of the specific cookie). When we use session cookies to track the total number of
            visitors to our Site, this is done on an anonymous aggregate basis (as cookies do not in themselves
            carry any personal data). We may also employ cookies so that we remember your computer when it is used
            to return to the Site to help customize your Gabriel Stan web experience. We may associate personal
            information with a cookie file in those instances.</p>


        <h3>1.1. How Gabriel Stan uses cookies</h3>

        <p>We use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies from third-party partners such as Google and
            Facebook for measurement services, better targeting ads, and for marketing purposes. This takes place
            from the Site. These cookies, web beacons, and other
            storage technologies allow us to display Gabriel Stan promotional material to you on other sites you visit
            across the Internet. Gabriel Stan may also share information about your behavior on the Site with third
            parties (including operators of third-party websites and/or social networking sites) in order to show
            you targeted advertisements and other content that has been customized for you. We also use cookies to
            facilitate the Gabriel Stan Targeted Ads Program. In this Program, we use cookies to determine which ads
            users
            have seen, and how many times users have seen a particular ad.</p>

        <h3>1.2. Managing cookies in your browser</h3>

        <p>Use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set your
            browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. You can easily delete and manage any cookies that have
            been installed in the cookie folder of your browser by following the instructions provided by your
            particular browser manufacturer.</p>
